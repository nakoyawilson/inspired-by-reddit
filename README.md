# inspired-by-reddit

When I come across reddit posts asking for help in Python, I've gotten into the habbit of trying to solve the question without looking at the comments.

These are the questions I've attempted.

1. lottery_game.py inspired by the question in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o0xd0c/help_with_homework/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

2. pos_or_neg_integer.py inspired by the question in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o9tsfw/i_need_some_help_on_this_simple_program/

3. sum_and_average.py inspired by the question in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/od8rj6/newbie_question/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
